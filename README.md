# Common Reinforcement Learning algorithms implemented for the game Snake

Common reinforcement learning algorithms are applied to the game Snake. Some of my favorite runs are displayed below.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge [this repository](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch) which I originally used to get started with reinforcement learning. The basic structure of the snake game was lifted from the repository, however many things were changed in order to improve the display of the game and also to expand the context window to the entire board frame, plus additional board frames. Furthermore, the structure of this codebase was heavily inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/DragonWarrior15/snake-rl), where JSON files were parsed inorder to control the model parameters. I do want to note that almost all of this code was still written by me and inspiration was just lifted from these sources.
