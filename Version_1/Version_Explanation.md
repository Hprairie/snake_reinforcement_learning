# Version 1 of Using Deep Q Networks for Reinforcement Learning

The beginning model use a limited context of the imformation directly around the head, along with information about where the apple is in relation to the head.

The model uses a single neural network, $\epsilon$ decay for randomized exploration, and a replay buffer in order to improve training.
